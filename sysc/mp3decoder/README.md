# MP3 Decoder

This is model of a stream decoder application which converts MP3 streams to a raw audio format.
The model is based on the (H)SDF MoC.
Note that this is a reference model and it has not been optimized for performance.

The model reads the input from a test `.mp3` file and outputs the result to a `.raw` file.

This ForSyDe model is based on a model acquired from the CompSOC group at TU Eindhoven.
